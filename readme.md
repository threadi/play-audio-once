This repository is the database for the plugin _Play audio once_. This plugin makes it possible to set audio files in the Gutenberg editor so that a visitor can only play them once.

After checkout go through the following steps:

1. copy _build/build.properties.dist_ to _build/build.properties_.
2. modify the build/build.properties file - note the comments in the file.
3. execute the command in _build/_: `ant init`
4. after that the plugin can be activated in WordPress

## Release

1. increase the version number in _build/build.properties_.
2. execute the following command in _build/_: `ant build`
3. after that you will finde in the release directory a zip file which could be used in WordPress to install it.

## Translations

I recommend to use [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/) to translate texts for this plugin.

### generate pot-file

Run in main directory:

`wp i18n make-pot . languages/play-audio-once.pot --exclude=src,svn`

### update translation-file

1. Open .po-file of the language in PoEdit.
2. Go to "Translate" > "Update from POT-file".
3. After this the new entries are added to the language-file.

### export translation-file

1. Open .po-file of the language in PoEdit.
2. Go to File > Save.
3. Upload the generated .mo-file and the .po-file to the plugin-folder languages/

### generate json-translation-files

Run in main directory:

`wp i18n make-json languages`

OR use ant in build/-directory: `ant json-translations`
